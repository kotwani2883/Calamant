# Calamant Health App (Hack The Mountains 2.0)

## Problem Statement
During these Covid Times we all are stuck at our homes and Spending huge amount of time to social Media as it sometimes affecting our mental Health. Social media exacerbates mental health problems and allows us to start comparing ourselves to more exciting life appeared on screens. The world needs help taking a mental break to help their mental health.So we must take a break from certain sites that our attacking out mental health in Some Way or the other.Especially during these tough times when most of the countries are into lockdown it is very obvious for people to feel demotivated, stressed and also develop a feeling of Anxiety and mental Disorders.

## Inspiration
* Mental health apps can be effective in providing guidance in lifestyle and motivation to get relief from mental health issues and also making therapy more accessible, efficient, and portable.
* Many apps are available in the market for mental health but after researching we found that most were either specific to some particular mental health issues or just weren’t an ‘all-rounder’ app.

## Ideas
* Sites/ Apps affecting our mental health can be blocked using app blockers for a specific span of time and whenever we try to open these it redirects to our App Calamant.We are   desparately in need of an app to force us to stop spending so much time in one of the most toxic places on our mental Health.Also an Alternative to this can be Creating a BOT   which Would Monitor users Activity for a span of 30 min. If he opens the App the BOT would Automatically Redirect to our App which contains Mind Soothing Activities.
* Also In the chat feature , If the user feels lonely He could talk to Some anonymous and share his feelings either through blogs or Chatting.
* Aim to take input from the user how is he feeling and output an affirmation or words of encouragement. For this feature we will use Google Cloud Natural Language REST API to analyze a users submitted feelings and determine the sentiment of their submission. The GCN lang REST API basically sorts whether the input is positive or negative an drest api then sends back positive Thoughts if the input is -ve.


## Feature

* Login:User can Login  through email id and password
* Profile: Profile Conatins all the Entries entered by the user and also the appointments fixed with the Therapist
* Edit profile: He can chanhe his issues and concerns through this feature
* Talk with Zulu: Its a chatBot where user can talk with zulu to make him/her feel Motivated.
* Meme Creator: Fun Game to create Memes
* Games: Who doesn’t love bursting a bubble wrap?! The best ways to deal with stress & anxiety is to walk in rain, popping the bubble, and play other Mind Games
* Blogs and Journals: Here User can write experiences based on this current feelings. We are thinking of to convert this very feature into a Soacial Media Mental App where users can show their progress and motivate others too to take care of their mental as well as physical Health.
* Therapist Section: This is the Section where users can fix Appointment with the Therapist. 
* Meditate- This feature allows Users to Meditate for Fixed Amount of Time According to His Wish.

## Tech Stack
* React Native(FrontEnd)
* Mongodb( DataBase)
* Nodejs(Backend)
* Firebase(Journals)

## Challenges that We faced
We were working for the First Time with React native. Also the Implementation of our Ideas were Beyond our Tech Stack and we were finding it difficult to implement but at last we were able to make a complete  app which Would Definately help the World in treating Mental Health

## Why did we use React Native 
* React Native's popularity as a cross-platform app development solution is quite high and is still in the upward direction.
* Simple to Learn
* Easily Convertable into web app.
* Use case satisfiability
*  Faster Build With No Excessive Recompiling

## Why did we use Node as a backend framework
* Javascript library so highly compatible
* Node. js is very good at handling simultaneous connections
* Because of its unique I/O approach, Node. js excels in the types of scalable and real-time circumstances that we're increasingly asking of our web servers.
* Node. js is also fast and lightweight, and its ability to employ JavaScript code on both the frontend and backend opens up new development possibilities

Learning from this Project-
In this very Project I did not started blindly with creating an app and working on that
I followed these steps -
* Designing and doing POC(proof of concept) on various functionalities required
* Secondly we designed and anlysed various use cases
* Apart from this we made a proper flow diagram os how the things gonna carried out
* Then we decided the tech stack and databases to be used
* We also made understanding on the deployment of frontend,backend and databases
* Time managment and team spirit was the major learning from this
